# Single-Rollout Asynchronous Optimization for Agentic Reinforcement Learning

> [!abstract] 摘要（原文）
> Reinforcement learning (RL) is becoming increasingly important for post-training large language models (LLMs). Previous RL pipelines for LLMs were mostly synchronous and batch-interleaved, which is inefficient for long-horizon agentic tasks. Recently, asynchronous RL has emerged as a more efficient alternative by updating the model as rollouts arrive. However, existing asynchronous RL systems often emphasize throughput, while leaving training stability and task effectiveness largely underexplored. For example, a key challenge is that group-wise sampling in the widely-used GRPO framework does not naturally fit asynchronous agentic training. In this paper, we present Single-rollout Asynchronous Optimization (SAO) to address the stability and off-policy challenges in asynchronous RL. To reduce off-policy effects and improve generalization, we replace group-wise sampling with single-rollout sampling, that is, using one rollout per prompt. We further improve this single-rollout strategy with practical value-model training designs. To improve optimization stability, we introduce a strict double-side token-level clipping strategy. SAO is able to train stably for one thousand steps and consistently outperform GRPO and its variants on agentic coding and reasoning benchmarks, such as SWE-Bench Verified, BeyondAIME, and IMOAnswerBench. We also demonstrate that single-rollout RL is particularly effective in a simulated online learning setting, where the model must adapt to changing evolving environments. To this end, SAO is successfully deployed in the agentic RL pipeline for training the open GLM-5.2 model (750B-A40B).

> The performance of SAO on reasoning and coding benchmarks. The four reasoning benchmarks are evaluated in a reasoning-with-Python-tool setting, where the baseline is the Qwen3- 30B-A3B SFT model; SWE-Bench Verified evaluates coding with the Qwen3-30B-A3B baseline. SAO outperforms the corresponding baseline and GRPO across all five benchmarks. ∗Equal Contribution. Work done while ZH and YL interned

## 关键公式（LaTeX 源，可直接粘贴 Obsidian/报告）

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{1}{|y|} \sum_{t=1}^{|y|} \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
$$

$$
\hat{A}_t^{\text{GAE}} = \sum_{l=0}^{|y|-t-1} (\gamma \lambda)^l \delta_{t+l}
$$

$$
\hat{A}_{i,t} = \frac{R_i - \mu_R}{\sigma_R}, \quad \text{with} \quad \mu_R = \frac{1}{G}\sum_{j=1}^G R_j
$$

$$
L(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ f(r_t(\theta), \epsilon_l, \epsilon_h) \hat{A}_t \log \pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t) \right]
$$

$$
r_t(\theta) = \exp\left( \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) - \log \pi_{\text{rollout}}(a_t|s_t) \right)
$$

$$
f(x; \epsilon_\ell, \epsilon_h) = \begin{cases} x, & \text{if } 1-\epsilon_\ell < x < 1+\epsilon_h \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

$$
\hat{A}(a_{i, N}) = \delta + \gamma \lambda \hat{A}(a_{i+1, 0})
$$

$$
\delta = r_t + \gamma V(a_{i+1, 0}) - V(a_{i, N})
$$
